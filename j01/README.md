# Creating a playlist
## Wesley Casebeer, 3/16/2024
I used Apple Music for a long time for listening to music on my phone/computer, until I eventually made the switch to Spotify for the discounted user price and a far better Windows desktop application. I have enjoyed Spotify for the most part, it does very well in finding me new music, and it feels very satisfying and easy to use.
