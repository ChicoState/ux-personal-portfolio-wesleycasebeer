# Creating a playlist
## Wesley Casebeer, 3/16/2024
I used Apple Music for a long time for listening to music on my phone/computer, until I eventually made the switch to Spotify for the discounted user price and a far better Windows desktop application. I have enjoyed Spotify for the most part, it does very well in finding me new music, and it feels very satisfying and easy to use. 

I quickly figured out, though, that Spotify had one glaring weakness, and it came up when I was trying to make a playlist. The methods of making a playlist are very **inefficient** using Spotify, it can't be done nearly as quickly as it should be able to, and it becomes a serious problem when trying to make very large playlists, and I am someone who finds myself making playlists of 500+ songs, so this is a massive issue for me. When using Apple Music and making a playlist from scratch, you can press a button to add songs, and it will recommend some songs to add to your playlist and give you the typical methods of accessing music that you usually have, by scrolling through a list of songs, albums, artists, etc.

Using spotify, when you click to add music to a playlist, the option to scroll through your library is entirely absent. You are only given a list of songs it recommends you add to your playlist, and the ability to search for songs by name.
